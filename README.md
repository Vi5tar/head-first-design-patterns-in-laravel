# Chapter 6: Command Pattern

*Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize other objects with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.*

### Basic Usage:
```bash
$ vendor/bin/psysh
```

Get the vendor's light class:  
```php
$light = new App\Ch6\VendorClasses\Light('Dance Floor');
```

Get the **command** that knows how to turn the light on and pass it the light.  
```php
$lightOnCommand = new App\Ch6\Commands\LightOnCommand($light);
```

Get the **command** that knows how to turn the light off and pass it the light.
```php
$lightOffCommand = new App\Ch6\Commands\LightOffCommand($light);
```

Get the remote.  
```php
$remote = new App\Ch6\RemoteControl();
```

Set the first button to control the light.  
```php
$remote->setCommand(0, $lightOnCommand, $lightOffCommmand);
```

Turn the light on!  
```php
$remote->onButtonWasPushed(0); 

// The Dance Floor light is now on sucka!
```

Turn the light off!  
```php
$remote->offButtonWasPushed(0); 

// The Dance Floor light is now off bro!

The remote can also undo the last operation.

# Chapter 7: Adapter Pattern

*Converts the interface of a class into another interface the clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.*

# Chapter 8: Template Method Pattern

*Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.*

### Basic Usage:
```bash
$ vendor/bin/psysh
```
